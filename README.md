# full-stack-recruitment-test
Basic project structure for full stack web application

Client implementation:

We'd like you to use React. On top of that, use whatever front-end libraries you feel comfortable with.

We've set you up with a build on create-react-app. To run the client:

npm install

npm start - start the client development build at http://localhost:3000

Server implementation:

We'd like you to use Spring Boot for server implementation.

We've set you up with a basic spring boot application structure. 

To run the server:

mvn clean install

mvn spring-boot:run
